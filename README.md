# react-firebase-realTimeChatApp
i have vreated real time chat app using react and fire base   
its functional and it works but it needs more styling   
which is not the aim of the project so i will keep it this way until i create a full real time chat app using nodeJS and vreatin the back end by myself  instead of firebase
